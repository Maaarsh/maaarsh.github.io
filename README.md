# Marshall's Website

My personal website to display info, projects, and whatever else I want.

https://maaarsh.github.io/

## Ideas for site:

- ~~Social media links~~
- ~~About me~~
- ~~Contact info~~
- Interests tab
- Showcase of project(s)
- Typing game that displays my most recent, highest, and average WPM
  - Allow vistors of my site to play and try to beat my WPM
- Use Spotify API to display any/all of the following:
  - Top artist(s)
  - Top song(s)
  - Last played song
- Use Steam API to display any/all of the following:
  - Most played game(s)
    - And number of hours played
    - And when played last
  - Last played game
    - And number of hours played
    - And when played last
